<p>For the safety verification of transition systems, we typically must
perform some kind of <em>abstraction</em>. For finite transition
systems, verification is theoretically decidable, but practically it
suffers from the state space explosion problem, and so exhaustive
verification may be hard (e.g. exponential) in general. So, for any
systems of non-trivial size, abstraction is typically necessary. Finding
an inductive invariant to prove safety is, essentially, about finding a
suitable abstraction that overapproximates the set of reachable system
states. We presumably want this abstraction to be “concise" i.e. it is
expressible in a form (exponentially?) more compact than the set of
reachable states.</p>
<p>In general, in order to discover a “concise" inductive invariant we
work over some <em>abstraction domain</em>. Given a state space <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, we define an abstraction domain <span
class="math inline">\(D \subseteq 2^S\)</span> as simply a set of
subsets of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. For example, given
the state space defined by a single real valued variable <span
class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, a possible abstraction
domain is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    D_1 = \{x &gt; 2, x &lt; - 2\}
\end{aligned}\]</span> where each element of <span
class="math inline">\(D_1\)</span> is a subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, defined as a symbolic
predicate over <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>One way to define an abstraction domain for a state space <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is to explicitly define the set <span
class="math inline">\(D \subseteq 2^S\)</span>. Alternatively, we can
provide a set of atomic predicates and rules for for how these
predicates can be combined to form additional predicates. Our
abstraction domain is then defined as the space of all possible
composite predicates that can be formed as combinations of atomic
predicates using these operators (perhaps up to some bounded size). We
can consider this the <em>grammar-based</em> approach.</p>
<p>For example, for a state space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
we can define a <em>grammar</em> <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
as a pair <span class="math inline">\((P,O)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(P \subseteq 2^S\)</span> is a set of predicates on
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is a set of operators for combining
elements of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to form new
predicates on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. These operators
may be unary, binary, etc. For example, we may have a grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G_1 = (\{x&gt;2, x &lt; 3\}, \{\neg,
\vee\})\)</span>. The set <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> might
be composed of symbolic/logical operators, but in general <span
class="math inline">\(O\)</span> may contain any set-based operators
i.e. operators that take in some set of predicates of <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and produce new predicates in <span
class="math inline">\(2^S\)</span>.</p>
<p>For transition systems with a state space <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, we can also always work over a
“trivial” abstraction domain. That is, the domain <span
class="math inline">\(D_{\bot} = \{\{s\} \mid s \in S\}\)</span> that
consists of all “singleton" predicates i.e. those that contain a single
concrete state. We can view this domain as “minimally abstract”, since
the predicates don’t cover multiple states, and so don’t really perform
any “true" abstraction.</p>
