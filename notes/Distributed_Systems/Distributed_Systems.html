<ul>
<li><p>In a <strong>synchronous</strong> message passing system, there exists some known finite bound <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> on message delays. That is, for any message sent, an adversary can delay its delivery by at most <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. So, every process that sends messages at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> gets them delivered by time <span class="math inline">\(t+\Delta\)</span>. i.e., the whole system runs in lockstep, marching forward in perfectly synchronous rounds. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="2018abrahamsyncbyz">(<a href="#ref-2018abrahamsyncbyz" role="doc-biblioref">Abraham et al. 2019</a>)</span> provides a standard (modern) description of the synchronous model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an honest party <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> sends a message to another honest party <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> at the beginning of a round, the message is guaranteed to reach by the end of that round. We describe the protocol assuming lock-step execution, i.e., parties enter and exit each round simultaneously. Later...we will present a clock synchronization protocol to bootstrap lock-step execution from bounded message delay.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>In a fully <strong>asynchronous</strong> model, there is no upper bound on the delay for a message to be delivered, but we do assume that the delay is some finite value (e.g. chosen by an adversary). So, even though the message delay may be some unknown/unbounded quantity, we do assume that every message eventually gets delivered, even if the delay is unknown a priori.</p>
<p>The nature of asynchronous networks also implies that there is no way to have a perfect failure detector in a fully asynchronous system, since you can’t distinguish between a failed/stopped process and one whose messages are just taking a long time to get delivered.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>partial synchrony</strong> model aims to find a middle ground between the two above models. The assumption is that there exists some known finite time bound <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and a special event called GST (global stabilization time) such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The adversary must cause the GST event to eventually happen after some unknown finite time.</p></li>
<li><p>Any message sent at time <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> must be delivered by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta + max(x, GST)\)</span>. That is, after the GST, messages are delivered within the known finite time bound <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> (i.e. the system has “reverted" to synchrony).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>What are the fundamental differences between the synchronous and asynchronous models, and what exactly makes the latter harder?</em></p>

<section id="fault-tolerance" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Fault Tolerance</h1>
<p>There are some fundamental requirements to establish bounds for fault tolerance in an omission fault model. If an arbitrary set of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> nodes can fail by stopping at any time, then this means that if we want a protocol that makes progress, we would need to ensure that any “work” we do (e.g. executing operations, writing down data, etc.) is made sufficiently redundant so that it can be accessed even in the case of maximum node failure. So, this implies we need to write all data to at least <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes, so that there is always at least one non-faulty node with the data we need to access. So, this seems to imply that having simply <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> total nodes might be sufficient for a fault tolerant protocol. But, this still doesn’t satisfy a progress requirement, since if we now need to write everything down to <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes, then failure of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes clearly stalls our protocol, since it can do any work safely. So, our additional requirement is that both</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>we must write any work down to <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes and</p></li>
<li><p>that we always have <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> non-faulty nodes available that we can write work down on</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, this naturally gives us a total node requirement of <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    n = f + (f+1) = 2f + 1\end{aligned}\]</span> That is, even in the case of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maximum node failures, we will always have <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes available to us to write down our work, allowing us to make progress.</p>

<section id="byzantine-fault-tolerance" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h1>
<p>The earliest explicit reference to <em>Byzantine</em> faults appeared in <span class="citation" data-cites="1982lamportshostak">(<a href="#ref-1982lamportshostak" role="doc-biblioref">Lamport, Shostak, and Pease 1982</a>)</span>, though earlier work had touched on the same problem without referring to it by that moniker <span class="citation" data-cites="1980peasereaching 1978sift">(<a href="#ref-1980peasereaching" role="doc-biblioref">Pease, Shostak, and Lamport 1980</a>; <a href="#ref-1978sift" role="doc-biblioref">Wensley et al. 1978</a>)</span>. They show in <span class="citation" data-cites="1982lamportshostak">(<a href="#ref-1982lamportshostak" role="doc-biblioref">Lamport, Shostak, and Pease 1982</a>)</span> that when using “oral” messages (i.e. non-signed) messages, a Byzantine agreement solution requires <span class="math inline">\(3f+1\)</span> processes, even in a synchronous communication model. They give an algorithm that solves the problem assuming <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 3f+1\)</span>, and also show that if we allow for “written” (e.g. digitally signed) messages, then in the synchronous model Byzantine agreement can be achieved with only <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> processes.</p>
<section id="model" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Model</h2>
<p>The work on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance <span class="citation" data-cites="1999castropbft">(<a href="#ref-1999castropbft" role="doc-biblioref">Castro and Liskov 1999</a>)</span> considers an asynchronous distributed system where nodes are connected by a network which can fail to deliver messages, delay them, or deliver them out of order. Furthermore, it considers a Byzantine failure model i.e., faulty nodes may behave arbitrarily, subject only to the above restrictions. They do assume, however, cryptographic techniques that prevent spoofing and can detect corrupted messages. In other words, Byzantine processes can send any message, but we assume the identity of the sender of a message can be determined by the receiver <span class="citation" data-cites="2011lamport">(<a href="#ref-2011lamport" role="doc-biblioref">Lamport 2011</a>)</span>. This can be achieved this with public-key signatures <span class="citation" data-cites="1978rivestcrypto">(<a href="#ref-1978rivestcrypto" role="doc-biblioref">Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman 1978</a>)</span>, message authentication codes (MACs), etc.</p>

<section id="intuitions-and-algorithm" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Intuitions and Algorithm</h2>
<p>If we assume a starting point of a classic 2-phase Paxos consensus approach, the following are some of the essential issues that arise and must be dealt with when we add in Byzantine faults:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Leader equivocation</strong>: if a leader is faulty (Byzantine), then it can trivially send two conflicting messages in the same view (i.e. with the same proposal number). This means that, for example, it could send out and accept message with its own proposal number but with a different value to each replica. Then, we would end up with a quorum of replicas having accepted that proposal, but they all have different values, so which one is the true value to agree upon?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrong value adoption</strong>: A leader (faulty or not) that accepts a wrong value (i.e. not highest among previously) chosen can lead to safety violation as considered in the standard 2-phase Paxos model.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A key idea of the algorithm is about how we deal with the issue of potentially Byzantine leaders. That is, we need to protect against leaders sending conflicting messages to different followers such that we would violate the constraints needed to ensure safety in, for example, classic asynchronous consensus Paxos in the standard omission (non Byzantine) fault model. If a leader is faulty and just went ahead and followed the standard 2-phase protocol used in Paxos (<em>prepare</em> + <em>accept</em>), then in the <em>prepare</em> phase it could tell different replicas arbitrarily different things i.e. tell them to accept one value and then change this value</p>
<p>The essence of the algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Primary sends a <span class="math inline">\(pre\_prepare(value, p)\)</span> message for view/proposal number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Replica responds to the first <span class="math inline">\(pre\_prepare\)</span> message it receives from a primary.</p></li>
<li><p>Primary gathers <span class="math inline">\(pre\_prepare\)</span> responses from <span class="math inline">\(n-f\)</span> replicas, and then sends <span class="math inline">\(prepare(v, proof)\)</span> (note this message may be linear in size since it contains signed codes fro m up to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> nodes.)</p></li>
<li><p>If a replica sees <span class="math inline">\(prepare(value, p, proof)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(proof\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(n-f\)</span> valid signatures for <span class="math inline">\(pre\_prepare(value, p)\)</span>, then it goes ahead and accepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Primary then gathers <span class="math inline">\(n-f\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(prepare\)</span> responses from replicas.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that since we assume a public key infrastructure (PKI) set up between nodes of the system, any node can securely verify that a message was signed by some another node.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.3"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Given <span class="math inline">\(n=3f+1\)</span> nodes, for any 2 quorums with <span class="math inline">\(n-f = 2f+1\)</span> nodes, we are guaranteed they intersect in at least <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes (just draw a picture). Note that if you talk to at least <span class="math inline">\(f+1\)</span> nodes then you are sure you are in contact with at least one non-faulty (non-Byzantine) node.</p></li>
