\title{MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency (EuroSys 2013)}
\author{William Schultz}

\maketitle


MDCC \cite{2013mdcc} describes an optimistic commit protocol for geo-replicated transactions that does not require a master or static partitioning, and is strongly consistent with cost similar to eventually consistent protocols.

It combines a bunch of tricks for optimizing commit latency, including ideas from Generalized Paxos, Fast Paxos. It only provides read committed isolation. Essentially, it (1) runs a \textit{per-record} Generalized Paxos instance and (2) ensures every prepare has been received by a fast quorum of replicas (3) disallows aborts for successfully prepared records and (4) piggybacks notifications of commit state on subsequent transactions.
