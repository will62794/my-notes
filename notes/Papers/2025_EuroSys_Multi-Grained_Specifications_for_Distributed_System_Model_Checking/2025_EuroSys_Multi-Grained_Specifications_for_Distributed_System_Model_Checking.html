data-cites="2025multigrained">(<a href="#ref-2025multigrained"
role="doc-biblioref">Ouyang et al. 2025</a>)</span> describes an
approach for specifying and verifying ZooKeeper. They write abstract
TLA+ models of the ZooKeeper protocol, while also checking conformance
between the model and code. To tackle state space explosion of models,
they decompose the specs into modules which are then written at
different "granularities", and composed together for checking
properties.</p>
<section id="multi-grained-specifications" class="level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Multi-Grained Specifications</h1>
<p>The basic idea of multi-grained specifications is based around the
ability to decompose an overall system specification into separate
logical modulues, which can independently be specified at different
"granularities" (e.g. levels of atomicity), and then composed together
in a semantics preserving way. This enables efficient model checking by
reliance on <em>interaction preservation</em> idea, which was introduced
in prior work <span class="citation"
data-cites="gu2022compositionalmodelcheckingconsensus">(<a
href="#ref-gu2022compositionalmodelcheckingconsensus"
role="doc-biblioref">Gu et al. 2022</a>)</span>. The idea is that, for a
given module, its behavior can be defined in terms of its
<em>interactions</em> with other modules. Its "internal" behavior is
irrelevant to the operation of the overall, composed system, so can be
abstracted away as long as high level correctness properties don’t
depend on any of this internal state.</p>
<p>In TLA+, they define global state of a system with <em>variables</em>
and states are updated with <em>actions</em>. They define <em>dependency
variables</em> of an action as the variables in the enabling condition
of the action. A <em>module</em> is defined as a set of actions, and the
dependency variables of a module are then defined as the union of
dependency variables for all actions in the module.</p>
<p>They claim that coarsening of a module preserves interaction if</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>All dependency variables of the target module, as well as all
interaction variables, remain unchanged after the coarsening.</p></li>
<li><p>All the updates of the dependency variables and interaction
variables remain unchanged after the coarsening.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So, overall, if you can describe a specification <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as composed of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> modules as <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    S = \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq n} M_i
\end{aligned}\]</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\overset{\sim}{M_i}\)</span> represents the
coarsened version of module <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span>,
then if the above hold, then <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> is
denoted as the specification by coarsening <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with every other module except <span
class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> i.e. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    S_i = \left(\bigcup_{j \neq i} \overset{\sim}{M_j}\right) \cup M_i
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>They claim the main theorem, the <strong>Interaction Preservation
Theorem</strong>, which says essentially that:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>. <em>Given <span class="math inline">\(S =
\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq n} M_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S_i = \left(\bigcup_{j \neq i}
\overset{\sim}{M_j}\right) \cup M_i\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(T_S \overset{M_i}{\sim} T_{S_i}\)</span>.</em></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T_S \overset{M_i}{\sim}
T_{S_i}\)</span> is defined as trace <span
class="math inline">\(T_S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(T_{S_i}\)</span> being equal when projected to
<span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span></p>

<h1 class="unnumbered">Conformance Checking and Tooling</h1>
<p>They built a tool called <span class="smallcaps">Remix</span>, which
includes a conformance checking framework for checking ZooKeeper
implementation against their specifications. The conformance checker
explores random traces of the model-level state space under some budet,
and then runs these model traces checking for discrepancies between
implementation and model. As they describe it, apparently developers
still need to manually provide a mapping from each model-level action to
the events in the code that represent the beginning and end of the
corresponding code-level action. They use some Java specific
instrumentation tools (AspectJ) to achieve all of this, but it seems the
manual burden of defining these conformance mappings is still
high/nontrivial</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered">Evaluation Results</h1>
<p>Basically, they find a bunch of bugs. They also note the significant
efficiency gains from checking multi-grained specifications. They note
in some cases over 1000x speedups in exploration costs, as illustrated
in Table 5.</p>

<section id="thoughtsquestions" class="level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Thoughts/Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Are their interaction-preserving coarsenings guaranteed to be
formally correct in any way, or are they just eyeballing it? For
bug-finding, eyeballing is arguably ok, since you’re not as worried
about completeness, and if you find a candidate bug, you can check it
manually for veracity. But for completeness, I feel sketchy about their
approach being formally correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Conformance checking still seems laborious, as with many other
papers on the topic. Not really sure if there’s much to take away from
that aspect i.e. it seems there was a lot of manual effort involved and
is not clear it would be be easy to do in general for many systems.
Multi-grained specification aspect seems the main value here.</p></li>
