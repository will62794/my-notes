\section{Random Variables}

We can model probabilistic events based on \textit{outcomes}, which are the outcome of an experiment or a trial (e.g., getting a ``3'' on the roll of a die), and a \textit{sample space}, which is a set of possible outcomes, and \textit{events}, which are a subset of the sample space. 

A \textbf{random variable} is then, formally, simply a mapping from outcomes in the sample space to the set of real numbers. For example consider a 6-sided die with sides $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Some possible outcomes are $1$, $3$, or $5$, and the sample space is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. The probability of each outcome for a fair die, deteremined by some random variable, is $1/6$. We can define an event $A$ representing the case that the roll is odd i.e., $A=\{1,3,5\}$.

\subsection*{Expected Value}
The \textbf{expected value} of a random variable $X$ can be thought of as the ``average'' or ``mean'' value attained by that random variable. Formally, expected value is defined as
\begin{align*}
    E[X] = \sum_{x} x * P(X=x)
\end{align*}
for every outcome $x$ in the sample space of $X$. For example, for a fair, 6-sided die, the expected value is 
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{6}*1 + \frac{1}{6}*2 + \frac{1}{6}*3 + \frac{1}{6}*4 + \frac{1}{6}*5 + \frac{1}{6}*6 = 3.5
\end{align*}
Or if we have, say, a 4-sided die where each roll has some ``payoff'', e.g. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 $\mapsto$ 1
    \item 2 $\mapsto$ 2
    \item 3 $\mapsto$ 3
    \item 4 $\mapsto$ 10
\end{itemize}
our expected payoff from rolling this die is
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{4}*1 + \frac{1}{4}*2 + \frac{1}{4}*3 + \frac{1}{4}*10 = 4
\end{align*}
