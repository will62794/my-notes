\title{Weakest Preconditions}
\author{William Schultz}
\maketitle

The notion of \textit{weakest precondition} in program analysis derives from the work of Dijkstra \cite{1975dijkstrawp}. He introduced the \textit{Guarded Command Language} as a simple modeling language for program specification e.g.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{gcl_grammar.png}
\end{center}
So, given a program $S$ and a postcondition $\varphi$, we define the \textit{weakest precondition} as the weakest property of the input state that guarantees that $S$ will terminate with the postcondition $\varphi$, denoted $wp(S, \varphi)$. In the definition of GCL, we can provide definitions of how to compute the weakest precondition for various program statements. For example, for an assignment statement $x := E$, we have that
\begin{align*}
    wp(x := E, \varphi) \equiv \varphi\{E/x\}
\end{align*}
where $\varphi\{E/x\}$ represents the property $\varphi$ with appearances of $x$ in $\varphi$ replaced with $E$. For example,
\begin{align*}
    wp(x := x + 1, x = 3) &\equiv (x = 3)\{x+1/x\} \\
    & \equiv (x+1) = 3\\
    & \equiv x = 2\\
\end{align*}

From a more semantic perspective, we can also think about weakest preconditions in terms of symbolic transition relations. If we have a transition relation $T$ and a postcondition $\varphi$ (i.e. a state predicate), the weakest precondition of $T$ with respect to $\varphi$ is the weakest predicate $P$ (in other words, the largest set of states) such that a transition out of any state in $P$ will uphold the property $\varphi$.

\end{center}
We can also consider weakest precondition computation as a kind of \textit{backwards symbolic execution}. That is, we start from a given postcondition predicate, and a given transition relation, and execute the transition relation backwards to compute the states contained in the weakest precondition.
