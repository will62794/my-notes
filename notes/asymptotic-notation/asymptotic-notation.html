<h1 class="title">Asymptotic Notation</h1>

<p>If we want to describe the runtime of a Turing machine (i.e. a program), we describe it based on the size of the input. That is, how does the runtime scale as the input size scales. If we were to look at the performance on a single input, it would be difficult to compare one Turing machine against another since its specific runtime could be affected by many other factors e.g. speed of the machine running the program, etc. So, we look at the <em>asymptotic</em> behavior of the machine as input sizes go to infinity. There are a variety of notations for describing the worst case runtime, best case runtime, etc. The notations below describes the asymptotic behavior of a function <span class="math inline">f(n)</span> in terms of a function <span class="math inline">g(n)</span>. In the Turing machine case, <span class="math inline">f</span> represents the runtime (i.e. the number of steps taken) of a machine as a function of the input size, <span class="math inline">n</span>.</p>
<p>Note that for the classes below, like <span class="math inline">O(g(n))</span>, the <span class="math inline">\in</span> and <span class="math inline">=</span> symbols are, in practice, often used interchangeably, even though the former is technically correct. For example, <span class="math inline">O(g(n))</span> describes an entire family of functions (i.e. all functions asymptotically bounded above by <span class="math inline">g</span>), so saying <span class="math inline">f = O(g(n))</span> is really an abuse of notation. Writing <span class="math inline">f \in O(g(n))</span> is more precise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Big O (Upper Bound)</strong>: <span class="math inline">f(n) \in O(g(n))</span></p>
<p>Establishes an upper bound i.e. worst case complexity. Formally, <span class="math inline">\exists c &gt; 0</span> such that as <span class="math inline">n</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\infty</span>, <span class="math inline">f(n) \leq c*g(n)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">f</span> is bounded above by <span class="math inline">g</span>, within some constant factor, as <span class="math inline">n</span> approaches infinity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Big Omega (Lower Bound)</strong>: <span class="math inline">f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))</span></p>
<p>Establishes a lower bound i.e. best case complexity. More formally, <span class="math inline">\exists c &gt; 0</span> such that as <span class="math inline">n</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\infty</span>, <span class="math inline">f(n) \geq c*g(n)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">f</span> is bounded below by <span class="math inline">g</span>, within some constant factor, as <span class="math inline">n</span> approaches infinity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Big Theta</strong>: <span class="math inline">f(n) \in \Theta(g(n))</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">f</span> is bounded asymptotically both above and below by <span class="math inline">g(n)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">f \in O(g(n))</span> and <span class="math inline">f \in \Omega(g(n))</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Small O</strong>: <span class="math inline">f(n) \in o(g(n))</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">f</span> is dominated by <span class="math inline">g</span> asymptotically. Can think of this as a variant of Big O notation but saying something stronger i.e. <span class="math inline">f \in o(g(n))</span> implies <span class="math inline">f \in O(g(n))</span>. The function <span class="math inline">f</span> is not only bounded above by <span class="math inline">g</span> but is dominated by <span class="math inline">g</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">f</span>’s asymptotic growth is strictly less than <span class="math inline">g</span>’s growth. Formally, we can state this by saying that <span class="math inline">\forall c &gt; 0</span>, as <span class="math inline">n</span> goes to infinity, <span class="math inline">f(n) \leq c*g(n)</span>. As a concrete example, <span class="math inline">x^2 \in o(x^3)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Small Omega</strong>: <span class="math inline">f(n) \in \omega(g(n))</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">f</span> dominates <span class="math inline">g</span> asymptotically. Similar to <span class="math inline">o(g(n))</span> but establishes a strict lower bound. It is a stronger statement than <span class="math inline">f \in \Omega(g(n))</span>, saying that <span class="math inline">f</span>’s asymptotic growth is strictly greater than <span class="math inline">g</span>’s.</p></li>
